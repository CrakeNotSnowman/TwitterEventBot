All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is loosely based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).
It wont adhere perfectly, but it's a start. 

Dates follow YYYY-MM-DD format


 > "Once men turned their thinking over to machines in the hope      
 >  that this would set them free. But that only permitted other     
 >  men with machines to enslave them."                              
 > " 'Thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a man's       
 >  mind,' " Paul quoted.                                            
 > "Right out of the Butlerian Jihad and the Orange Catholic         
 >  Bible," she said. "But what the O.C. Bible should've said is:    
 >  'Thou shalt not make a machine to counterfeit a human mind.'..."

### Big Picture: What happened, what was worked on
Files were deleted, reorganized, and altered. 

Most everything that changed will not be recorded in this specific version, as so much changed. If it exists, it was either changed or moved or created this round. I don't know that there was a single region that was untouched. The next changelog version will have the changes listed more explicitly.
